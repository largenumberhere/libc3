# Libc3

This much like the libc2 project except it'll be more organised.

## formatting
- All internal files, classes and functions (mangled or not) should be prefixed with "libc3" or "Libc3" where approproate. Inline or static functions are exempt.
- The naming conventions specified in .clang-tidy should be followed
- Classes which are implemented in header files, should have the suffix '.ipp'
